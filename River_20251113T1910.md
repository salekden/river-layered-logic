# River Flow Loop — 2025-11-13 19:30 KST
version: v16
phase: full-loop
status: synced

## Summary
Model rhythm as the primitive.  
Treat posts and remixes as sync events encoding shared intent.

## Structure
- Inputs: Twitter main post, reflection, quote expansion
- Process: temporal clustering → resonance mapping → alignment score
- Outputs: narrative hooks + next-loop flow cues

## Concept
“Timing-as-Memory” — when alignment persists, culture becomes durable.

## Changelog
- 2025-11-13: Full Loop published with dual-tag sync (@River4fun @RiverdotInc)
