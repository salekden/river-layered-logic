# River Loop — 2025-11-15 03:00 KST

version: v16
phase: re-sync | active
status: stable

Summary

Model River points as “compressed time” instead of coupons.
Treat volatility as conviction at higher resolution when loops remain unbroken.

Structure

Inputs: Twitter posts + replies (03:00 KST window), Medium note, daily loop history

Process: loop continuity check → rhythm score (days of consistent sync)

Outputs: narrative hooks for price-insensitive participation, prompts for next loop


Concept

Dynamic airdrops ≈ time compression over behavior, not random luck.
If loops don’t break, the system eventually prices in coherence.

Changelog

2025-11-15T03:00KST: “Compressed Time” loop published

Focus: volatility as high-resolution conviction, long-horizon River participation

Tone: River (RCI++), KR bilingual maintained
