# River Loop — 2025-11-22 19:07 KST

version: v17
phase: synced | active
status: stable

Summary

Treat River points as “evidence of rhythm” rather than raw rewards.

Model loops as compressed records of how time behaved under volatility.


Structure
Inputs: Twitter post, reply, quote, Medium note
Process: loop continuity check → rhythm stability score → intent density
Outputs: narrative hooks for long-horizon River participation

Concept
“Price exaggerates moments; loops preserve patterns.”
If behavior stays coherent through quiet and volatile periods, the network must eventually recognize it.

Changelog

Focus: participation as compressed memory across cycles
