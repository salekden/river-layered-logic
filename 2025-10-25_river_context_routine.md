# River v16.1R â€” Context-Weighted Routine (19:00 KST)

## Hypothesis
Markets lack interpretation, not data. Weight signals by context.

## Micro-Routine
- T+0: Publish framing tweet (mid-sentence tags: @RiverdotInc @River4fun).
- T+5/10/15: Like / RT / reinforcing reply (self).
- T+40: Quote a relevant KOL post (external bridge).

## Early Notes
- Context-coherent bursts outperformed raw volume spikes during event-dense windows.
- Next: integrate cross-chain flows + news-heat.

## Log
- 2025-10-25: First public iteration; Medium post at 22:00 KST.
